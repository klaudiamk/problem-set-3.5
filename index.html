    <h2>Acrylics, Watercolor, and Oils</h2>
    <p>Acrylic, watercolor, and oil paints are the most common and basic painting mediums. The base foundation of each is obviously pigment, but the binding material in each is what makes them unique.This gives them each different texture, color, application, and drying time. Acrylics are suspended in a water based plastic polymer resin, which makes them dry very quickly and have easy water cleanup. They can also be diluted in water to mimic a watercolor consistency. Oils are quite the opposite of acrylics. Since they are suspended in oil, most commonly linseed oil, it take a very long time for them to dry. These works can take anywhere from a few days to a few years to dry completly. Clean-up also requires special luqiuds as oil does not mix with water. Watercolor is suspended in gum arabic, making it the only paint that can be lifted after it is dry. This means the paint can be removed or erased from the surface. It is often applied in layers to add depth and tone to the artwork.</p>
